# Intro

Create tables for the examples below and add primary keys and foreign keys. Add some test data. You can create tables with GUI or writing SQL (it's your choice)

Write SQL-statements (select ... join) that extract info from the tables

You will only need two or three tables

## Exercise

A person has a name. 

A passport belongs to a country.

One person can have many passports. 

Some people don't have any passports.

A passport always belongs to someone.

A person may have many passports but not multiple passports for the same country.
