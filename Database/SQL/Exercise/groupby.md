## Exercise: Person table

Create a new database and name it Demo

Create a table "Person" with columns:
- Name
- Country    (a string)
- Income     (a whole number)

## Exercise: add data

Add the following data:

	Mia 	Sweden 	20000
	Olivia 	Iceland 50000
	James 	Sweden 	25000
	Liam 	Sweden 	28000
	Ava		Iceland 60000
	Lisa 	Spain 	10000

## Count

Use "count" to count number of rows in each group, so you get:

	2
	1
	3

Try

	select count(*) 
	from Person 
	group by Country

And try

	select count(*) as Inhabitants
	from Person 
	group by Country

## Exercise: two columns

Adjust the query so you get.

	Iceland	 2
	Spain	 1
	Sweden	 3

## Exercise: show the average income

Show the average of income by nation:

	Iceland	55000	2
	Spain	10000	1
	Sweden	24333	3


Hint: use AVG(MyColumnName) to get the average

## Filter with HAVING

Continue, but only show countries with at least 2 inhabitants

	Iceland	55000	2
	Sweden	24333	3


Filter the groups with "HAVING" (you can't use "WHERE" in this case)

	select Country, AVG(Income) as Average, COUNT(*)  as Inhabitants
	from Person 
	group by Country
	having count(*)>=2

## Filter with WHERE

Get all countries that starts with the letter "S"

	Spain	1
	Sweden	3

"WHERE" is used to filter rows before the grouping. (in this case "HAVING" would work as well)

	select Country, count(*) as Inhabitants
	from Person 
	where Country like 'S%'
	group by Country 

## Hint

HAVING and WHERE are similar. Both are about filtering.

HAVING is about filtering **groups**

WHERE is about filtering **rows**

## Exercise: start with L

Get number of inhabitants with names starting with "L" in each country

	Spain	1
	Sweden	1

## Group by - common errors (SELECT)

Below follows some common errors when dealing with GROUP BY

Try the following. What's the problem here?

	select count(*) as Inhabitants, Income 
	from Person 
	group by Country

You'll get:

	Column 'Person.Income' is invalid in the select list because it is not contained in either an aggregate function or the GROUP BY clause.

Explanation:

	The columns in "SELECT" can't be anything you like

	In the example above it doesn't work. E.g in Sweden not everyone has the same income.

	You'll get:


## Group by - common errors (HAVING)

Try the following. What's the problem here?

	select Country, count(*) as Inhabitants
	from Person 
	group by Country 
	having Name like 'L%'

You'll get:

	Column 'Person.Name' is invalid in the HAVING clause because it is not contained in either an aggregate function or the GROUP BY clause.

Explanation:

	The columns in "HAVING" can't refer to any column

	In the example above it doesn't work. E.g in Island not everyone has the same name.
