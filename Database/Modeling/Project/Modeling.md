# Project - modeling a database

## Brainstorming

Your group is going to create a database for a company.

Pick one of the companies in **Ideas.md** or choose another company.

Then start to answer questions below the **Analyse** header

(20 minutes)

We meet in Classroom and share our ideas.

## Analyse

To know what tables and fields to model it is useful to answer these questions:

- How will the company make money?
- Who will use the final app? (e.g customer, administrator, accounting, CEO...)
- What questions do the users of app want to answer?

E.g if you model a database for Voi the answer of the first question could be "By renting scooters to customers in mayor cities". 

Customer want to know
- Which scooters are close to me right now? 
- How much battery is left on the scooters close to me? 

Sales want to know
- In which areas do most of our customers ride? 
- How much money did we earn last month? 
- Which day of the week is most profitable? 

CEO want to know
- Where are our scooters right now?
- What is the status of our scooters?
- How do our customers rate their rides?
- How long does an ordinary ride take?

## Execute 

Search for
- People
- Things
- Locations
- Events

Create a ER-diagram with:
- Multiple **one-to-many** relationships
- Multiple **many-to-many** relationships

The ER-diagram must contain at least 6 entities.

Model the database from the ER-diagram.
